# alist_app

Developed by Lola Fearon and Samantha Molano 

The A-List is an interactive display and website to help users remember their essential items before leaving their homes. It is a standalone product that does not need to be connected to any smart home devices or integrated electronically into the house. With a click of a button, the user will instantly be reminded of their essential items as they head out the door, instead of needing to open their phone or laptop, locate the application or webpage, and check through there.

This code was made with HTML, Django, and hosted on Visual Studio Code. We deployed this code on a public server via Digital Ocean. Because we are also using a display screen, it can see the contents of the user checklist from a JSON File we configured.
